# Bank-Management-System
● Bank Management System is based on a concept of recording customer’s account details. Here the user can 
perform all the tasks like creating an account, deposit amount, withdraw amount, check balance, view all account 
holders detail, close an account and modify an account. There’s no login system for this project. All the main 
features for banking system are set in this project.

● This project uses classes and file handling features of C++. In order to store all the user’s data, an external file 
(DAT file) is created by the system, so every time we get into the system we can operate with the existing 
accounts. Bank Management System is developed using C++ Programming Language and different variables, 
strings have been used for the development of it. This project provides the simplest system for managing banking 
system.
